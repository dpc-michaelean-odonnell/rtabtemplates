Description: This package contains templates for use by DPC's Recovery Tracking
and analytics branch. The purpose is to speed the creation of RMarkdown documents
and ensure a consistent look and feel across all of our products. At present the
package only contains a single template for RTAB reports. This may expand in the
future.

To use the templates in this package install the package, then go to `File >
RMarkdown > From Template` and select `RTAB report template`.
